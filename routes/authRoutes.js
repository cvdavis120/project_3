//2nd argument is code to be executed whenever a request comes into this route. kick the user into OAuth flow which is being managed by passport. google strategy has code in it that knows a strategy called string google, when passport loads, if anyone attempts to authenticate and with string google, use this strategy. this is how passport knows to go find the strategy. 2nd argument is an options object and we passed in scope. the scope specifies to google what access we want to have inside of the users profile. the 2 strings passed in are not made up.
